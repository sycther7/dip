/*The fft() function is then used to compute the one-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the matrix x. The fft() function can be used to calculate the FFT of a signal along one or more dimensions. In this case, the second argument -1 specifies that the FFT should be computed along the columns of x.

The resulting FFT is stored in the matrix X.

Finally, the disp() function is used to display the matrix X with a label 'X[k]='. This displays the complex values of the FFT coefficients, which represent the frequency components of the input signal x.*/
