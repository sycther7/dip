/*clc is a MATLAB command that clears the command window, removing any text or output that was previously displayed.

The code you provided defines two matrices x and h using MATLAB's matrix notation. The disp() function is then used to display the matrices with labels 'x=' and 'h=', respectively.

The fft2() function computes the two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform of the matrices x and h. The resulting transforms are stored in variables X and H, respectively.

The .* operator is used to perform element-wise multiplication between X and H. This is followed by an inverse two-dimensional fast Fourier transform using ifft() to obtain the 2D circular correlation of x and h. The resulting matrix is stored in variable y.

Finally, disp() function is used again to display the resulting matrix y with a label '2D Circular Correlation Result: y ='.*/
